/*
 * Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: 
 * carPrice and color and method calculateSalePrice() 
 * which should be returning a price of the car.
Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. 
The Truck class has field as weight and has its own implementation 
of  calculateSalePrice() method 
in which returned price calculated as following: 
if weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount, 
otherwise 20% discount.
The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own implementation 
of calculateSalePrice(): 
if length of sedan is >20 feet 
then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10% discount
